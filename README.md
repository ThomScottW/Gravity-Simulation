# Gravity-Simulation
A 2D gravity simulation in Python, displayed using the third-party library pygame.

I used this tutorial to get an idea for how to implement the functions: https://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/tutorials/pygame-physics-simulation/gravitational-attraction/

I settled on a gravitational constant of 0.01, defined in SimModel.py

To run this, put the files in a folder and create a python virtual environment for that folder. Install pygame in that virtual environment, then run the file SimView.py
